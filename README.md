**What is Embedded Linux?**
Embedded Linux is a specialized version of the Linux operating system that is designed to run on embedded systems such as mobile devices, routers, and other IoT devices.

**Why Embedded Linux?**
It offers a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective, open-source nature for deep customization, extensive hardware support, vast community, and robust networking/security features, making it ideal for everything from IoT gadgets to complex industrial systems. 

**Who requires Embedded Linux?**
Device manufacturers and system designers developing smart and connected products require Embedded Linux.
Developers can strip it down for minimal resource use or build it up with extensive features, saving on licensing costs and benefiting from rapid development tools.

**Which applications demand Embedded Linux?**
Applications of devices that require high processing capability, multitasking, networking, security, and scalability.
Examples include routers, smart TVs, industrial controllers, and IoT gateways.

**When is the impact of Embedded Linux predominant?**
Its impact is predominant when devices need high performance, connectivity, and frequent updates.
It is most effective in long-life products with evolving software requirements.

**How does Embedded Linux work?**
Embedded Linux works through a layered architecture consisting of bootloader, kernel, root filesystem, and applications.
It interacts directly with hardware using device drivers while managing resources efficiently.
